## Introduction
# Chapter 5: Electric Charges and Fields
## 5.1 Electric Charge
## 5.2 Conductors, Insulators, and Charging by Induction
## 5.3 Coulomb's Law

Back when we were studying Newton’s laws, we identified several physical phenomena as forces.
We did so based on the effect they had on a physical object: Specifically, they caused the object to accelerate. Later,
when we studied impulse and momentum, we expanded this idea to identify a force as any physical phenomenon
that changed the momentum of an object. In either case, the result is the same: We recognize a force by the effect
that it has on an object.
In Gravitation (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/13-introduction), we examined the
force of gravity, which acts on all objects with mass. In this chapter, we begin the study of the electric force, which
acts on all objects with a property called charge. The electric force is much stronger than gravity (in most systems
where both appear), but it can be a force of attraction or a force of repulsion, which leads to very different effects on
objects. The electric force helps keep atoms together, so it is of fundamental importance in matter. But it also
governs most everyday interactions we deal with, from chemical interactions to biological processes.

## 5.1 Electric Charge
### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- 
Describe the concept of electric charge
- 
Explain qualitatively the force electric charge creates
You are certainly familiar with electronic devices that you activate with the click of a switch, from computers to cell
phones to television. And you have certainly seen electricity in a flash of lightning during a heavy thunderstorm. But
you have also most likely experienced electrical effects in other ways, maybe without realizing that an electric force
was involved. Let’s take a look at some of these activities and see what we can learn from them about electric
charges and forces.
Discoveries
You have probably experienced the phenomenon of static electricity: When you first take clothes out of a dryer,
many (not all) of them tend to stick together; for some fabrics, they can be very difficult to separate. Another
example occurs if you take a woolen sweater off quickly—you can feel (and hear) the static electricity pulling on your
clothes, and perhaps even your hair. If you comb your hair on a dry day and then put the comb close to a thin stream
of water coming out of a faucet, you will find that the water stream bends toward (is attracted to) the comb (Figure
5.2).
**FIGURE 5.2 An electrically charged comb attracts a stream of water from a distance. Note that the water is not touching the comb. (credit:**
![FIGURE 5.2 An electrically charged comb attracts a stream of water from a distance. Note that the water is not touching the comb. (credit:]({IMAGE_BASE_URL}/images/p02_img01_28.jpeg)

Suppose you bring the comb close to some small strips of paper; the strips of paper are attracted to the comb and
even cling to it (Figure 5.3). In the kitchen, quickly pull a length of plastic cling wrap off the roll; it will tend to cling to
most any nonmetallic material (such as plastic, glass, or food). If you rub a balloon on a wall for a few seconds, it will
stick to the wall. Probably the most annoying effect of static electricity is getting shocked by a doorknob (or a friend)
after shuffling your feet on some types of carpeting.

of this behavior helped lead to the concept of the electric force. (credit: Jane Whitney)
Many of these phenomena have been known for centuries. The ancient Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus
(624–546 BCE) recorded that when amber (a hard, translucent, fossilized resin from extinct trees) was vigorously
rubbed with a piece of fur, a force was created that caused the fur and the amber to be attracted to each other
(Figure 5.4). Additionally, he found that the rubbed amber would not only attract the fur, and the fur attract the
amber, but they both could affect other (nonmetallic) objects, even if not in contact with those objects (Figure 5.5).
**FIGURE 5.4 Borneo amber is mined in Sabah, Malaysia, from shale-sandstone-mudstone veins. When a piece of amber is rubbed with a**
![FIGURE 5.4 Borneo amber is mined in Sabah, Malaysia, from shale-sandstone-mudstone veins. When a piece of amber is rubbed with a]({IMAGE_BASE_URL}/images/p03_img02_37.jpeg)

piece of fur, the amber gains more electrons, giving it a net negative charge. At the same time, the fur, having lost electrons, becomes
positively charged. (credit: “Sebakoamber”/Wikimedia Commons)
**FIGURE 5.5 When materials are rubbed together, charges can be separated, particularly if one material has a greater affinity for electrons**

than another. (a) Both the amber and cloth are originally neutral, with equal positive and negative charges. Only a tiny fraction of the

charges are involved, and only a few of them are shown here. (b) When rubbed together, some negative charge is transferred to the amber,
leaving the cloth with a net positive charge. (c) When separated, the amber and cloth now have net charges, but the absolute value of the
net positive and negative charges will be equal.
The English physicist William Gilbert (1544–1603) also studied this attractive force, using various substances. He
worked with amber, and, in addition, he experimented with rock crystal and various precious and semi-precious
gemstones. He also experimented with several metals. He found that the metals never exhibited this force, whereas
the minerals did. Moreover, although an electrified amber rod would attract a piece of fur, it would repel another
electrified amber rod; similarly, two electrified pieces of fur would repel each other.
This suggested there were two types of an electric property; this property eventually came to be called electric
charge. The difference between the two types of electric charge is in the directions of the electric forces that each
type of charge causes: These forces are repulsive when the same type of charge exists on two interacting objects
and attractive when the charges are of opposite types. The SI unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C), after the
French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1736–1806).
The most peculiar aspect of this new force is that it does not require physical contact between the two objects in
order to cause an acceleration. This is an example of a so-called “long-range” force. (Or, as James Clerk Maxwell
later phrased it, “action at a distance.”) With the exception of gravity, all other forces we have discussed so far act
only when the two interacting objects actually touch.
The American physicist and statesman Benjamin Franklin found that he could concentrate charge in a “Leyden jar,”
which was essentially a glass jar with two sheets of metal foil, one inside and one outside, with the glass between
them (Figure 5.6). This created a large electric force between the two foil sheets.
**FIGURE 5.6 A Leyden jar (an early version of what is now called a capacitor) allowed experimenters to store large amounts of electric**
![FIGURE 5.6 A Leyden jar (an early version of what is now called a capacitor) allowed experimenters to store large amounts of electric]({IMAGE_BASE_URL}/images/p04_img01_45.jpeg)

charge. Benjamin Franklin used such a jar to demonstrate that lightning behaved exactly like the electricity he got from the equipment in his
laboratory.
Franklin pointed out that the observed behavior could be explained by supposing that one of the two types of charge
remained motionless, while the other type of charge flowed from one piece of foil to the other. He further suggested
that an excess of what he called this “electrical fluid” be called “positive electricity” and the deficiency of it be
called “negative electricity.” His suggestion, with some minor modifications, is the model we use today. (With the
172
5 • Electric Charges and Fields

---

experiments that he was able to do, this was a pure guess; he had no way of actually determining the sign of the
moving charge. Unfortunately, he guessed wrong; we now know that the charges that flow are the ones Franklin
labeled negative, and the positive charges remain largely motionless. Fortunately, as we’ll see, it makes no practical
or theoretical difference which choice we make, as long as we stay consistent with our choice.)
Let’s list the specific observations that we have of this electric force:
- 
The force acts without physical contact between the two objects.
- 
The force can be either attractive or repulsive: If two interacting objects carry the same sign of charge, the
force is repulsive; if the charges are of opposite sign, the force is attractive. These interactions are referred to
as electrostatic repulsion and electrostatic attraction, respectively.
- 
Not all objects are affected by this force.
- 
The magnitude of the force decreases (rapidly) with increasing separation distance between the objects.
To be more precise, we find experimentally that the magnitude of the force decreases as the square of the distance
between the two interacting objects increases. Thus, for example, when the distance between two interacting
objects is doubled, the force between them decreases to one fourth what it was in the original system. We can also
observe that the surroundings of the charged objects affect the magnitude of the force. However, we will explore
this issue in a later chapter.
Properties of Electric Charge
In addition to the existence of two types of charge, several other properties of charge have been discovered.
- 
Charge is quantized. This means that electric charge comes in discrete amounts, and there is a smallest
possible amount of charge that an object can have. In the SI system, this smallest amount is
. No free particle can have less charge than this, and, therefore, the charge on any
object—the charge on all objects—must be an integer multiple of this amount. All macroscopic, charged
objects have charge because electrons have either been added or taken away from them, resulting in a net
charge.
- 
The magnitude of the charge is independent of the type. Phrased another way, the smallest possible
positive charge (to four significant figures) is
, and the smallest possible negative charge is
; these values are exactly equal. This is simply how the laws of physics in our universe
turned out.
- 
Charge is conserved. Charge can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transferred from place to
place, from one object to another. Frequently, we speak of two charges “canceling”; this is verbal shorthand. It
means that if two objects that have equal and opposite charges are physically close to each other, then the
(oppositely directed) forces they apply on some other charged object cancel, for a net force of zero. It is
important that you understand that the charges on the objects by no means disappear, however. The net
charge of the universe is constant.
- 
Charge is conserved in closed systems. In principle, if a negative charge disappeared from your lab bench
and reappeared on the Moon, conservation of charge would still hold. However, this never happens. If the total
charge you have in your local system on your lab bench is changing, there will be a measurable flow of charge
into or out of the system. Again, charges can and do move around, and their effects can and do cancel, but the
net charge in your local environment (if closed) is conserved. The last two items are both referred to as the
law of conservation of charge.
The Source of Charges: The Structure of the Atom
Once it became clear that all matter was composed of particles that came to be called atoms, it also quickly became
clear that the constituents of the atom included both positively charged particles and negatively charged particles.
The next question was, what are the physical properties of those electrically charged particles?
The negatively charged particle was the first one to be discovered. In 1897, the English physicist J. J. Thomson was
studying what was then known as cathode rays. Some years before, the English physicist William Crookes had
shown that these “rays” were negatively charged, but his experiments were unable to tell any more than that. (The
fact that they carried a negative electric charge was strong evidence that these were not rays at all, but particles.)

Thomson prepared a pure beam of these particles and sent them through crossed electric and magnetic fields, and
adjusted the various field strengths until the net deflection of the beam was zero. With this experiment, he was able
to determine the charge-to-mass ratio of the particle. This ratio showed that the mass of the particle was much
smaller than that of any other previously known particle—1837 times smaller, in fact. Eventually, this particle came
to be called the electron.
Since the atom as a whole is electrically neutral, the next question was to determine how the positive and negative
charges are distributed within the atom. Thomson himself imagined that his electrons were embedded within a sort
of positively charged paste, smeared out throughout the volume of the atom. However, in 1908, the New Zealand
physicist Ernest Rutherford showed that the positive charges of the atom existed within a tiny core—called a
nucleus—that took up only a very tiny fraction of the overall volume of the atom, but held over 99% of the mass.
(See Linear Momentum and Collisions (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/
9-introduction).) In addition, he showed that the negatively charged electrons perpetually orbited about this
nucleus, forming a sort of electrically charged cloud that surrounds the nucleus (Figure 5.7). Rutherford concluded
that the nucleus was constructed of small, massive particles that he named protons.
**FIGURE 5.7 This simplified model of a hydrogen atom shows a positively charged nucleus (consisting, in the case of hydrogen, of a single**
![FIGURE 5.7 This simplified model of a hydrogen atom shows a positively charged nucleus (consisting, in the case of hydrogen, of a single]({IMAGE_BASE_URL}/images/p06_img01_54.jpeg)

proton), surrounded by an electron “cloud.” The charge of the electron cloud is equal (and opposite in sign) to the charge of the nucleus, but
the electron does not have a definite location in space; hence, its representation here is as a cloud. Normal macroscopic amounts of matter
contain immense numbers of atoms and molecules, and, hence, even greater numbers of individual negative and positive charges.
Since it was known that different atoms have different masses, and that ordinarily atoms are electrically neutral, it
was natural to suppose that different atoms have different numbers of protons in their nucleus, with an equal
number of negatively charged electrons orbiting about the positively charged nucleus, thus making the atoms
overall electrically neutral. However, it was soon discovered that although the lightest atom, hydrogen, did indeed
have a single proton as its nucleus, the next heaviest atom—helium—has twice the number of protons (two), but four
times the mass of hydrogen.
This mystery was resolved in 1932 by the English physicist James Chadwick, with the discovery of the neutron. The
neutron is, essentially, an electrically neutral twin of the proton, with no electric charge, but (nearly) identical mass
to the proton. The helium nucleus therefore has two neutrons along with its two protons. (Later experiments were to
show that although the neutron is electrically neutral overall, it does have an internal charge structure. Furthermore,
although the masses of the neutron and the proton are nearly equal, they aren’t exactly equal: The neutron’s mass is
very slightly larger than the mass of the proton. That slight mass excess turned out to be of great importance. That,
however, is a story that will have to wait until our study of modern physics in Nuclear Physics (http://openstax.org/
books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/10-introduction).)
Thus, in 1932, the picture of the atom was of a small, massive nucleus constructed of a combination of protons and
neutrons, surrounded by a collection of electrons whose combined motion formed a sort of negatively charged
“cloud” around the nucleus (Figure 5.8). In an electrically neutral atom, the total negative charge of the collection of
electrons is equal to the total positive charge in the nucleus. The very low-mass electrons can be more or less easily
removed or added to an atom, changing the net charge on the atom (though without changing its type). An atom that
174

has had the charge altered in this way is called an ion. Positive ions have had electrons removed, whereas negative
ions have had excess electrons added. We also use this term to describe molecules that are not electrically neutral.
**FIGURE 5.8 The nucleus of a carbon atom is composed of six protons and six neutrons. As in hydrogen, the surrounding six electrons do not**
![FIGURE 5.8 The nucleus of a carbon atom is composed of six protons and six neutrons. As in hydrogen, the surrounding six electrons do not]({IMAGE_BASE_URL}/images/p07_img01_65.jpeg)

have definite locations and so can be considered to be a sort of cloud surrounding the nucleus.
The story of the atom does not stop there, however. In the latter part of the twentieth century, many more
subatomic particles were discovered in the nucleus of the atom: pions, neutrinos, and quarks, among others. With
the exception of the photon, none of these particles are directly relevant to the study of electromagnetism, so we
defer further discussion of them until the chapter on particle physics (Particle Physics and Cosmology
(http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/11-introduction)).
A Note on Terminology
As noted previously, electric charge is a property that an object can have. This is similar to how an object can have a
property that we call mass, a property that we call density, a property that we call temperature, and so on.
Technically, we should always say something like, “Suppose we have a particle that carries a charge of
”
However, it is very common to say instead, “Suppose we have a
charge.” Similarly, we often say something
like, “Six charges are located at the vertices of a regular hexagon.” A charge is not a particle; rather, it is a property of
a particle. Nevertheless, this terminology is extremely common (and is frequently used in this book, as it is
everywhere else). So, keep in the back of your mind what we really mean when we refer to a “charge.”
## 5.2 Conductors, Insulators, and Charging by Induction
### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- 
Explain what a conductor is
- 
Explain what an insulator is
- 
List the differences and similarities between conductors and insulators
- 
Describe the process of charging by induction
In the preceding section, we said that scientists were able to create electric charge only on nonmetallic materials
and never on metals. To understand why this is the case, you have to understand more about the nature and
structure of atoms. In this section, we discuss how and why electric charges do—or do not—move through materials
(Figure 5.9). A more complete description is given in a later chapter.

conducting wires allow electrons to move freely through the cables, which are shielded by rubber and plastic. These materials act as
insulators that don’t allow electric charge to escape outward. (credit: modification of work by “Evan-Amos”/Wikimedia Commons)
Conductors and Insulators
As discussed in the previous section, electrons surround the tiny nucleus in the form of a (comparatively) vast cloud
of negative charge. However, this cloud does have a definite structure to it. Let’s consider an atom of the most
commonly used conductor, copper.
For reasons that will become clear in Atomic Structure (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/
pages/8-introduction), there is an outermost electron that is only loosely bound to the atom’s nucleus. It can be
easily dislodged; it then moves to a neighboring atom. In a large mass of copper atoms (such as a copper wire or a
sheet of copper), these vast numbers of outermost electrons (one per atom) wander from atom to atom, and are the
electrons that do the moving when electricity flows. These wandering, or “free,” electrons are called conduction
electrons, and copper is therefore an excellent conductor (of electric charge). All conducting elements have a
similar arrangement of their electrons, with one or two conduction electrons. This includes most metals.
Insulators, in contrast, are made from materials that lack conduction electrons; charge flows only with great
difficulty, if at all. Even if excess charge is added to an insulating material, it cannot move, remaining indefinitely in
place. This is why insulating materials exhibit the electrical attraction and repulsion forces described earlier,
whereas conductors do not; any excess charge placed on a conductor would instantly flow away (due to mutual
repulsion from existing charges), leaving no excess charge around to create forces. Charge cannot flow along or
through an insulator, so its electric forces remain for long periods of time. (Charge will dissipate from an insulator,
given enough time.) As it happens, amber, fur, and most semi-precious gems are insulators, as are materials like
wood, glass, and plastic.
Charging by Induction
Let’s examine in more detail what happens in a conductor when an electrically charged object is brought close to it.
As mentioned, the conduction electrons in the conductor are able to move with nearly complete freedom. As a
result, when a charged insulator (such as a positively charged glass rod) is brought close to the conductor, the (total)
charge on the insulator exerts an electric force on the conduction electrons. Since the rod is positively charged, the
conduction electrons (which themselves are negatively charged) are attracted, flowing toward the insulator to the
near side of the conductor (Figure 5.10).
Now, the conductor is still overall electrically neutral; the conduction electrons have changed position, but they are
still in the conducting material. However, the conductor now has a charge distribution; the near end (the portion of
the conductor closest to the insulator) now has more negative charge than positive charge, and the reverse is true of
the end farthest from the insulator. The relocation of negative charges to the near side of the conductor results in an
overall positive charge in the part of the conductor farthest from the insulator. We have thus created an electric
charge distribution where one did not exist before. This process is referred to as inducing polarization—in this case,
polarizing the conductor. The resulting separation of positive and negative charge is called polarization, and a
material, or even a molecule, that exhibits polarization is said to be polarized. A similar situation occurs with a
176
5 • Electric Charges and Fields

---

negatively charged insulator, but the resulting polarization is in the opposite direction.
**FIGURE 5.10 Induced polarization. A positively charged glass rod is brought near the left side of the conducting sphere, attracting negative**
![FIGURE 5.10 Induced polarization. A positively charged glass rod is brought near the left side of the conducting sphere, attracting negative]({IMAGE_BASE_URL}/images/p09_img01_82.jpeg)

charge and leaving the other side of the sphere positively charged. Although the sphere is overall still electrically neutral, it now has a
charge distribution, so it can exert an electric force on other nearby charges. Furthermore, the distribution is such that it will be attracted to
the glass rod.
The result is the formation of what is called an electric dipole, from a Latin phrase meaning “two ends.” The
presence of electric charges on the insulator—and the electric forces they apply to the conduction
electrons—creates, or “induces,” the dipole in the conductor.
Neutral objects can be attracted to any charged object. The pieces of straw attracted to polished amber are neutral,
for example. If you run a plastic comb through your hair, the charged comb can pick up neutral pieces of paper.
Figure 5.11 shows how the polarization of atoms and molecules in neutral objects results in their attraction to a
charged object.
**FIGURE 5.11 Both positive and negative objects attract a neutral object by polarizing its molecules. (a) A positive object brought near a**
![FIGURE 5.11 Both positive and negative objects attract a neutral object by polarizing its molecules. (a) A positive object brought near a]({IMAGE_BASE_URL}/images/p09_img02_83.jpeg)

neutral insulator polarizes its molecules. There is a slight shift in the distribution of the electrons orbiting the molecule, with unlike charges
being brought nearer and like charges moved away. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, there is a net attraction. (b) A
negative object produces the opposite polarization, but again attracts the neutral object. (c) The same effect occurs for a conductor; since
the unlike charges are closer, there is a net attraction.
When a charged rod is brought near a neutral substance, an insulator in this case, the distribution of charge in atoms
and molecules is shifted slightly. Opposite charge is attracted nearer the external charged rod, while like charge is
repelled. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, the repulsion of like charges is weaker than the
attraction of unlike charges, and so there is a net attraction. Thus, a positively charged glass rod attracts neutral
pieces of paper, as will a negatively charged rubber rod. Some molecules, like water, are polar molecules. Polar
molecules have a natural or inherent separation of charge, although they are neutral overall. Polar molecules are
particularly affected by other charged objects and show greater polarization effects than molecules with naturally
uniform charge distributions.
When the two ends of a dipole can be separated, this method of charging by induction may be used to create
charged objects without transferring charge. In Figure 5.12, we see two neutral metal spheres in contact with one
another but insulated from the rest of the world. A positively charged rod is brought near one of them, attracting
negative charge to that side, leaving the other sphere positively charged.

of the world. (b) A positively charged glass rod is brought near the sphere on the left, attracting negative charge and leaving the other
sphere positively charged. (c) The spheres are separated before the rod is removed, thus separating negative and positive charges. (d) The
spheres retain net charges after the inducing rod is removed—without ever having been touched by a charged object.
Another method of charging by induction is shown in Figure 5.13. The neutral metal sphere is polarized when a
charged rod is brought near it. The sphere is then grounded, meaning that a conducting wire is run from the sphere
to the ground. Since Earth is large and most of the ground is a good conductor, it can supply or accept excess charge
easily. In this case, electrons are attracted to the sphere through a wire called the ground wire, because it supplies a
conducting path to the ground. The ground connection is broken before the charged rod is removed, leaving the
sphere with an excess charge opposite to that of the rod. Again, an opposite charge is achieved when charging by
induction, and the charged rod loses none of its excess charge.

## 5.3 Coulomb's Law
### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- 
Describe the electric force, both qualitatively and quantitatively
- 
Calculate the force that charges exert on each other
- 
Determine the direction of the electric force for different source charges
- 
Correctly describe and apply the superposition principle for multiple source charges
Experiments with electric charges have shown that if two objects each have electric charge, then they exert an
electric force on each other. The magnitude of the force is linearly proportional to the net charge on each object and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. (Interestingly, the force does not depend on the
mass of the objects.) The direction of the force vector is along the imaginary line joining the two objects and is
dictated by the signs of the charges involved.
Let
- 
the vector force exerted by charge 1 on charge 2;
- 
the vector displacement from
to
.
The magnitude of the electric force
on one of the charges is proportional to the magnitude of its own charge and
the magnitude of the other charge, and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them:
This proportionality becomes an equality with the introduction of a proportionality constant. For reasons that will
become clear in a later chapter, the proportionality constant that we use is actually a collection of constants. (We
discuss this constant shortly.)
COULOMB’S LAW
The magnitude of the electric force (or Coulomb force) between two electrically charged particles is equal to
If the charges have the same sign, the force is in the same direction as
showing a repelling force. If the charges

Newton’s third law (every force exerted creates an equal and opposite force) applies as usual—the force on

opposite in direction to the force it exerts on
. (a) Like charges; (b) unlike charges.
It is important to note that the electric force is not constant; it is a function of the separation distance between the
two charges. If either the test charge or the source charge (or both) move, then
changes, and so does the force. An
immediate consequence of this is that direct application of Newton’s laws with this force can be mathematically
difficult, depending on the specific problem at hand. It can (usually) be done, but we almost always look for easier
methods of calculating whatever physical quantity we are interested in. (Conservation of energy is the most
common choice.)
Finally, the new constant
in Coulomb’s law is called the permittivity of free space, or (better) the permittivity of
vacuum. It has a very important physical meaning that we will discuss in a later chapter; for now, it is simply an
empirical proportionality constant. Its numerical value (to three significant figures) turns out to be
These units are required to give the force in Coulomb’s law the correct units of newtons. Note that in Coulomb’s law,
the permittivity of vacuum is only part of the proportionality constant. For convenience, we often define a Coulomb’s
constant:

For the purposes of this example, we are treating the electron and proton as two point particles, each with an
electric charge, and we are told the distance between them; we are asked to calculate the force on the electron. We
thus use Coulomb’s law.
Solution
Our two charges and the distance between them are,
The magnitude of the force on the electron is
As for the direction, since the charges on the two particles are opposite, the force is attractive; the force on the
electron points radially directly toward the proton, everywhere in the electron’s orbit. The force is thus expressed as
Significance
This is a three-dimensional system, so the electron (and therefore the force on it) can be anywhere in an imaginary
spherical shell around the proton. In this “classical” model of the hydrogen atom, the electrostatic force on the
electron points in the inward centripetal direction, thus maintaining the electron’s orbit. But note that the quantum
mechanical model of hydrogen (discussed in Quantum Mechanics (http://openstax.org/books/university-physics-
volume-3/pages/7-introduction)) is utterly different.

What would be different if the electron also had a positive charge?
Multiple Source Charges
The analysis that we have done for two particles can be extended to an arbitrary number of particles; we simply
repeat the analysis, two charges at a time. Specifically, we ask the question: Given N charges (which we refer to as
source charge), what is the net electric force that they exert on some other point charge (which we call the test
charge)? Note that we use these terms because we can think of the test charge being used to test the strength of the
force provided by the source charges.
Like all forces that we have seen up to now, the net electric force on our test charge is simply the vector sum of each
individual electric force exerted on it by each of the individual source charges. Thus, we can calculate the net force
on the test charge Q by calculating the force on it from each source charge, taken one at a time, and then adding all
those forces together (as vectors). This ability to simply add up individual forces in this way is referred to as the
principle of superposition, and is one of the more important features of the electric force. In mathematical form,
this becomes
In this expression, Q represents the charge of the particle that is experiencing the electric force
, and is located at
from the origin; the

position of the ith charge to the position of Q. Each of the N unit vectors points directly from its associated source
charge toward the test charge. All of this is depicted in Figure 5.16. Please note that there is no physical difference
between Q and
; the difference in labels is merely to allow clear discussion, with Q being the charge we are
determining the force on.

other seven forces. This is the essence of the superposition principle.
(Note that the force vector
does not necessarily point in the same direction as the unit vector
; it may point in
the opposite direction,
. The signs of the source charge and test charge determine the direction of the force on
the test charge.)
There is a complication, however. Just as the source charges each exert a force on the test charge, so too (by
Newton’s third law) does the test charge exert an equal and opposite force on each of the source charges. As a
consequence, each source charge would change position. However, by Equation 5.2, the force on the test charge is a
function of position; thus, as the positions of the source charges change, the net force on the test charge necessarily
changes, which changes the force, which again changes the positions. Thus, the entire mathematical analysis
quickly becomes intractable. Later, we will learn techniques for handling this situation, but for now, we make the
simplifying assumption that the source charges are fixed in place somehow, so that their positions are constant in
time. (The test charge is allowed to move.) With this restriction in place, the analysis of charges is known as
electrostatics, where “statics” refers to the constant (that is, static) positions of the source charges and the force is
referred to as an electrostatic force.

Strategy
We use Coulomb’s law again. The way the question is phrased indicates that
is our test charge, so that
and
are source charges. The principle of superposition says that the force on
from each of the other charges is
unaffected by the presence of the other charge. Therefore, we write down the force on
from each and add them
together as vectors.
Solution
We have two source charges
and
a test charge

and we are asked to find a
force. This calls for Coulomb’s law and superposition of forces. There are two forces:
We can’t add these forces directly because they don’t point in the same direction:

−x-direction, while
points only in the +y-direction. The net force is obtained from applying the Pythagorean
theorem to its x- and y-components:

that is,

Significance
Notice that when we substituted the numerical values of the charges, we did not include the negative sign of either
or
. Recall that negative signs on vector quantities indicate a reversal of direction of the vector in question. But
for electric forces, the direction of the force is determined by the types (signs) of both interacting charges; we
determine the force directions by considering whether the signs of the two charges are the same or are opposite. If
you also include negative signs from negative charges when you substitute numbers, you run the risk of
mathematically reversing the direction of the force you are calculating. Thus, the safest thing to do is to calculate
just the magnitude of the force, using the absolute values of the charges, and determine the directions physically.
It’s also worth noting that the only new concept in this example is how to calculate the electric forces; everything
else (getting the net force from its components, breaking the forces into their components, finding the direction of
the net force) is the same as force problems you have done earlier.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- 
Explain the purpose of the electric field concept
- 
Describe the properties of the electric field
- 
Calculate the field of a collection of source charges of either sign
As we showed in the preceding section, the net electric force on a test charge is the vector sum of all the electric
forces acting on it, from all of the various source charges, located at their various positions. But what if we use a
different test charge, one with a different magnitude, or sign, or both? Or suppose we have a dozen different test
charges we wish to try at the same location? We would have to calculate the sum of the forces from scratch.
Fortunately, it is possible to define a quantity, called the electric field, which is independent of the test charge. It
only depends on the configuration of the source charges, and once found, allows us to calculate the force on any
test charge.
Defining a Field
Suppose we have N source charges
, applying N electrostatic forces on a test charge Q, at
displacements
from the source charges. The net force on Q is (see Equation 5.2)
